If you suspect that you had responded to a suspicious
  email or suspected that your online account might
  be compromised, immediately contact the company
  (who made/issued your account) and immediately
  change your password using their official website.

Companies and mobile carriers do not use the
  standard 11-digit or 12-digit (for Philippine) cellphone
  numbers to send promo-related SMS.

Social Media platforms are now verifying the accounts
  or pages in their website to make sure that it is
  authentic. Verified accounts or pages will have a
  mark, indicating that it is verified. Always look for the
  mark when viewing an account or page to confirm
  their authenticity. An example is Facebook, where
  they will add a check mark or badge beside the name
  of the verified account or page.
